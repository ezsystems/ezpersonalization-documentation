# 1. Introduction

Please read the [About Personalization](../about_personalization.md) and [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart_guide.md) for a short introduction.

!!! note "E-Commerce vs. Publisher Wording"

    This guide's wording is more related to the E-Commerce Personalization Solution but can be used for a thorough understanding of a Publisher Personalization Solution as well.

    Keep in mind that a [product](../../definitions.md#product) or item can be referred to as [content](../../definitions.md#content) and the buy event for non-paid publisher content is replaced by the consume event.

    There's also a page with [Definitions](../../definitions.md) which we strongly recommend reading in advance.
