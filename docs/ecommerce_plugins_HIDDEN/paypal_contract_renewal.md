# Renewing PayPal contract

PayPal has a built-in security mechanism that expires a customer contract (subscription) after one year.

After this happens, you need to add payment information again to renew the contract.

The steps are the same as during registration:

Step 1: Go to [Yoochoose web page](https://admin.yoochoose.net) and log in with your email and password.

Step 2: At the top of the page, click your login and choose **Edit contract data** (Vertragsdaten ändern).

A new window opens with the Billwerk partner site.
Billwerk is responsible for handling Personalization payments.

Step 3:  In the Billwerk customer portal, in the section **Ihre Zahlungsdaten** (Payment method), click **Ändern** (Change) to select a payment method.
